# MEDOX Token (MDC)

The MDC token is the native currency of the MEDOX blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## MDC utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the MEDOX blockchain, MDC is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake MEDOX to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.mdcscan.com/](https://status.mdcscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked MDC. Which means validators with higher amounts of MEDOX staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any MDC holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of MDC they wish. They receive a share of the MEDOX block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As MDC is the native currency on MEDOX, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, MDC transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of MDC tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the MEDOX platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;

### Where to Farm

At the moment, the MDC token is sometimes used by the project team to power liquidity rewards (yield farming) programs to boost liquidity on DEXes and the participation in the [MEDOX Lending Network](./#fuse-utility).

The ongoing liquidity rewards programs on DEXes can be discovered [here](https://app.voltage.finance/index.html#/farm/59273).
