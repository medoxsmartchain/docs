# Nordek Token (NRK)

The NRK token is the native currency of the Nordek blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## NRK utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Nordek blockchain, NRK is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Nordek to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.nordekscan.com/](https://status.nordekscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked NRK. Which means validators with higher amounts of Nordek staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any NRK holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of NRK they wish. They receive a share of the Nordek block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As NRK is the native currency on Nordek, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, NRK transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of NRK tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Nordek platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
